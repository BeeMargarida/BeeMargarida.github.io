<p>
	My name is Ana Margarida Silva and I am a software engineer. I don’t have any preference on which
	side of the stack I work on and I’m always willing to learn new things. Currently I’m learning
	Rust, exploring Svelte, tinkering with some ESP32s and contributing to some awesome open-source
	projects.
