# About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="../images/photo.jpg" alt="Profile picture">

My name is Ana Margarida Silva and I am a software engineer. I don't have any preference on which side of the stack to work on, and I'm always willing to learn new things. Currently I'm learning Rust and exploring the world of Internet of Things.

# Work

#### <span class="title-intro">></span> **Software Engineer** @ [Platforme](https://platforme.com/) [September 2020 - Present]
* Full-stack work in both core services and client-facing interfaces. Used Python, NodeJS, TypeScript, VueJS, ReactJS and others.

#### <span class="title-intro">></span> **Software Engineer Trainee** @ [Platforme](https://platforme.com/) [October 2019 - September 2020]
* Worked part-time in several projects, including backend and core services as well as frontend in several products that interface with clients.

#### <span class="title-intro">></span> **Summer Internship** @ [Blip](https://blip.pt/) [July 2018 - September 2018]

# Education

#### <span class="title-intro">></span> Masters Degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering @ [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/WEB_PAGE.INICIAL) [2015 - 2020]
* **Dissertation in Orchestration for Automatic Decentralization in Visually-defined IoT**: Development of a prototype, extending from Node-RED, that enables the automatic decentralization of an IoT system. The devices in the network communicate their computational capabilities to the orchestrator, which is responsible for automatically partitioning the computation and sending the generated tasks to the devices, leveraging their computational power.
