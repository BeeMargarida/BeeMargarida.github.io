# About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="../images/photo.jpg" alt="Profile picture">

My name is Ana Margarida Silva and I am a software engineer. I don't have any preference on which side of the stack I work on and I'm always willing to learn new things. Currently I'm learning Rust, exploring Svelte, tinkering with some ESP32s and contributing to some awesome open-source projects.

# Work

#### <span class="title-intro">></span> **Software Engineer** @ [Replai](https://www.replai.io/) [July 2022 - Present]
* Full-stack work on a fast paced startup whose product is a video intelligence platform that uses computer-vision AI to tag creatives at scale and help app developers understand what are the key drivers or detractors of performance of their video creatives. Technologies used are Typescript, NodeJS, React and PostgreSQL.

#### <span class="title-intro">></span> **Software Engineer** @ [Platforme](https://platforme.com/) [September 2020 - June 2022]
* Worked on a startup that used 3D models to power their made-to-order pipeline. The products worked on ranged from a web and mobile app for customizing 3D models (VueJS/React Native), a mobile application to follow and update the order’s status on the factory floor (React Native), the backend to power all of this (Python and NodeJS) and micro-services that complimented with additional functionality (NodeJS, Apache Kafka, Typescript). In addition to this, also developed SDKs to integrate with the platform.

#### <span class="title-intro">></span> **Software Engineer Trainee** @ [Platforme](https://platforme.com/) [October 2019 - September 2020]
* Worked part-time in several projects, including backend and core services as well as frontend in several products that interface with clients.

#### <span class="title-intro">></span> **Summer Internship** @ [Blip](https://blip.pt/) [July 2018 - September 2018]
* Development of a testing and inspection tool for serialized content in Apache Kafka topics. Blog post of the experience [here](https://ppb.technology/2018/09/18/a-summer-internship-at-paddypowerbetfair/).

# Projects

#### <span class="title-intro">></span> Maintainer and contributor of [SvelteUI](https://www.svelteui.org/) library
* Maintainer and contributor of a Svelte component and utility library

# Education

#### <span class="title-intro">></span> Masters Degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering @ [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/WEB_PAGE.INICIAL) [2015 - 2020]
* **Dissertation in Orchestration for Automatic Decentralization in Visually-defined IoT**: Development of a prototype, extending from Node-RED, that enables the automatic decentralization of an IoT system. The devices in the network communicate their computational capabilities to the orchestrator, which is responsible for automatically partitioning the computation and sending the generated tasks to the devices, leveraging their computational power. [Thesis](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/128520) and [code](https://github.com/BeeMargarida/node-red).
